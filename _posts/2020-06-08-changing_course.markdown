I was raised in a rural farming community of 300 people in southern Idaho. I spent the school years playing sports and the summer breaks driving a tractor. I remember being wildly excited when we first got Wi-Fi at home during my senior year. I share all this to say that I never could have guessed I would find myself in a software engineering bootcamp. 

When I relocated to Atlanta for my first job, I got a small taste of what coding was like from a friend I met in the software industry. Even as a full-time teacher, my interest in coding spurred into motivation to complete tutorials such as Codecademy and Udemy on my own. I loved the challenge of coding and discovered new possibilities with each lesson. As I continued to learn, my friend told me about bootcamps. I was sold on the idea after I spoke to people from the Flatiron School and others whose life changed following a bootcamp.  

Changing course can be difficult but I know transitioning to a career in the software industry will satisfy my desire to continuously learn, solve problems, and collaborate with others. I am grateful for the opportunity to develop my coding skillset and intend to put in the work necessary to leverage technology and succeed as a software engineer.
